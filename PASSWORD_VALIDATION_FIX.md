# Password Validation Fix

## Problem
The password requirements were overly restrictive and didn't match what was actually being enforced by Supabase. Users were being required to create passwords with:
- At least 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one symbol

This was too strict for a learning app and was causing unnecessary friction during account creation and password changes.

## Solution
Simplified the password requirements to be more user-friendly and reasonable:

### Before (Overly Restrictive):
```typescript
const requirements = {
  length: password.length >= 8,
  uppercase: /[A-Z]/.test(password),
  lowercase: /[a-z]/.test(password),
  number: /\d/.test(password),
  symbol: /[!@#$%^&*()_+\-=\[\]{};':"\\|,.<>\/?]/.test(password),
};
```

### After (User-Friendly):
```typescript
const requirements = {
  length: password.length >= 6,
};
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `src/utils/passwordValidation.ts`
- ✅ Removed uppercase requirement
- ✅ Removed lowercase requirement  
- ✅ Removed number requirement
- ✅ Removed symbol requirement
- ✅ Reduced minimum length from 8 to 6 characters
- ✅ Updated error messages to be simpler
- ✅ Updated requirements list to show only length requirement

### 2. Updated Requirements Text
- **Before**: "Password must be at least 8 characters long and contain uppercase, lowercase, number, and symbol."
- **After**: "Password must be at least 6 characters long."

### 3. Updated Requirements List
- **Before**: 5 requirements (length, uppercase, lowercase, number, symbol)
- **After**: 1 requirement (length only)

## Examples of Now-Accepted Passwords
- ✅ `password` (8 chars)
- ✅ `123456` (6 chars)
- ✅ `simple` (6 chars)
- ✅ `test123` (7 chars)
- ✅ `password123` (11 chars)

## Examples of Still-Rejected Passwords
- ❌ `pass` (4 chars - too short)
- ❌ `abc` (3 chars - too short)
- ❌ `a` (1 char - too short)

## Files Modified
1. `src/utils/passwordValidation.ts` - Main validation logic
2. `test-password-validation.js` - Test script (created)

## Impact
- ✅ Users can now create accounts with simple passwords
- ✅ Password changes are much easier
- ✅ Reduced friction during onboarding
- ✅ Still maintains basic security (6+ characters)
- ✅ Matches Supabase's default requirements

## Testing
The simplified validation has been tested and works correctly. Users can now use passwords like:
- `password`
- `123456`
- `simple`
- `test123`

This makes the app much more user-friendly while still maintaining reasonable security standards.
